# **Play it here : **

Verb challenge extravaganza is a quiz-inspired all age online game in which two players compete to win the title of verb GOAT. 

Because we all know how cumbersome the learning of English conjugation can get, the verb challenge extravaganza was designed to help students master this topic in a different, fun and challenging way.

The game consists of a set of questions players must answer in turns in order to earn some points. At different moments during the game, players will have to face extra challenges that will allow them to win some extra points. The first player to reach 40 points will be declared the winner.

In order to play, players must enter their names on the game’s home page. Players will then be prompted to choose between starting the game right away, and consulting online resources on irregular verbs, modal verbs and general conjugation, to refresh their memory before they start.

The **first round** consists of a set of multiple choice questions related to regular verb conjugation. The player that gets to answer the question is the one whose name is highlighted on the screen. For each correct answer, the players will earn 2 points.Each bad answer will however cost them 1 point. The first player to reach 10 or more points will trigger the **irregular verbs challenge**. 

During this challenge, players will get to see or hear base forms of irregular verbs and be prompted to type the corresponding past simple and past participle forms. Players each have 60 seconds to make the longest streak of right answers. For each correct answer, the player will hear their answer pronounced. If both forms are correct, the streak counter will increase by one and the player will move one to the next verb. If the player’s answer is incorrect, the player will hear an animal sound instead, and be asked to identify which animal they just heard through a multiple choice question. In case of a right answer, the player will get another try at guessing the verb’s forms. The challenge ends whenever the time’s up or a player fails to identify the animal they heard. The player’s total streak number is then multiplied by 2 and added to the player’s score. When both players have faced the challenge, the second round begins.

The **second round** consists of a set of multiple choice questions related to modal verbs. The rules are the same as in round 1 except every correct answer will get the players 3 points. Whenever a player reaches 25 or more points, the final challenge begins.

The **final challenge** consists of harder questions for which no choice answers will be provided. For each correct answer, the players will be awarded 5 points. No points will be lost in case of an incorrect answer.

The first player to reach 40 points WINS !
